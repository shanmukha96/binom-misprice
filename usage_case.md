1. Call & Put Mispricing as Alpha Signals
Short‑term directional trades
• Screen for strikes where market price ≫ theoretical price → potential overpricing to short calls/long puts.
• Vice versa for underpricing.

Algorithmic execution
• Feed the per‑strike mispricing series into an automated order‑placement engine (e.g. trade when mispricing crosses a threshold).

Volatility arbitrage
• Compare implied‐vol‐driven BS prices versus tree prices to detect discrepancies in early‐exercise premium for American puts.

2. Composite Mispricing for Hedging & Portfolio Construction
Delta‑neutral hedged strategies
• Use the composite score (weighted call+put mispricing) to pick option positions while simultaneously hedging delta with the underlying—capturing pure “mispricing” alpha.

Risk‑balanced overlays
• Overlay a composite‐based short option portfolio on an equity index to generate carry income with capped risk.

Signal diversification
• Combine composite mispricing with other factors (momentum, value) in a long/short portfolio to reduce idiosyncratic exposure.

3. Pricing Primitives for Risk Management & Calibration
Model validation
• Use binomial_tree_price and black_scholes_price to back‐test and compare pricing residuals across your live book.

Greeks & scenario analysis
• Extend the tree output (by bumping inputs) to compute ∆, Γ, Θ numerically for risk limits and P&L attribution.

Stress‐testing
• Reprice entire option chain under adverse vols or rates scenarios to gauge portfolio sensitivity.

4. Feature Engineering for Quant & Machine‑Learning Models
Regression inputs
• Use per‐strike mispricing (or composite) as explanatory variables in cross‐sectional return regressions or a multi‐factor model.

Time‑series forecasting
• Feed a rolling window of mispricing factors into an LSTM/ARIMA model to predict short‑term return reversals.

Clustering & regime detection
• Cluster stocks by their mispricing profiles to identify regimes where certain sectors tend to misprice more.

5. High‑Throughput Batch & CLI Integration
Daily universe scan
• Schedule compute_mispricing_batch via cron to generate end‑of‑day signals across 200+ tickers.

Ad‑hoc CLI runs
• Use the genomis CLI in shell scripts for rapid debugging, backtests, or one‑off analyses without spinning up Python.

6. R Interface for Research & Visualization
Seamless R workflows
• Import mispricing tables directly into your R dashboards (shiny, ggplot) for presentation to portfolio managers.

Statistical tests
• Run cointegration tests between mispricing series and realized returns, or t‑tests on pre‑/post‑earnings mispricing.

In Summary
Call/Put mispricing → pure alpha signals & volatility arbitrage triggers

Composite mispricing → hedged overlays, risk‑balanced income strategies

Pricing APIs → risk management, Greeks, calibration

Batch + CLI → operational automation at scale

Regression & ML features → richer factor models, predictive analytics

Use these building blocks to craft everything from a simple “trade when mispricing > X” script to a fully automated, hedged, multi‐factor trading system.
